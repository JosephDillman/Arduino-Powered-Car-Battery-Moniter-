# Arduino-Powered-Car-Battery-Moniter-
For this introduction to engineering course my design team and I constructed a system that would attach to a car battery and alert the user via text message when the voltage had fallen to a low and critical level assuming something had been draining the battery and was not shut off. The system used an arduino micro-controller which was connected to a GSM shield. The concept was intended to allow the user to also send a text message back to the modem in order to disconnect the battery from the car to avoid further drainage, however the GSM shield faced problems in communicating to the arduino and was left as a future concept. Regardless, we created a system that could be placed onto a car battery and manage notifications if the voltage were to fall to a specific level.
